        1978;Buffalo NY

        This video shows that Cory handmade hacked Super Mario Brothers cartridge
        and Nintendo NES video-game system. By altering the game's code, he removed
        the sound and all visual elements except the clouds. Cory's intensions were
        to master creative exploration; he often learned new programming language
        to develop new work.</h1>

        <h1>Frederick Hammersley
            1919; Salt Lake City, UT
            In 1968, Hammersley, began using the University of New Mexico's IBM mainframe computer to make images through an iterative process 
            (repeated cycles of variations.) He mastered these creations by using the computer program ART I.This work demostrated the connecetions
            between natural and programming language by using the alphabet itself.

               1984; Los Angeles, CA
               Baby feat. Ikaria, 2013
               Live simulation,sound,artificial intelligence service;infinite duration
               Cheng's software enables an audible conversation between three online chatbots whosw voices animate a swirl of debris.
               This software contains three different customized chatbots from an online service so that they "talk" to each other. The 
               debris repeatedly coalescing and then disintegrating and sometimes appearing as an active agent and often as an ambiguous hybrid.
               The floating debris can capture an artificial intelligence that is lifelike yet mechanistic, that reflects the mix of nonhuman
               and human conversations that increasingly permeates our live.
