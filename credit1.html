        This video shows that Cory handmade hacked Super Mario Brothers cartridge
        and Nintendo NES video-game system. By altering the game's code, he removed
        the sound and all visual elements except the clouds. Cory's intensions were
        to master creative exploration; he often learned new programming language
        to develop new work.</h1>
