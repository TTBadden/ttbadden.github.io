            <p>Meet STAR, a tough-as-nails young woman, who came up in the foster care  system and decides one day to take control of her destiny. Star tracks down her sister, SIMONE, and her Instagram bestie, ALEXANDRA, and together, the trio journeys to Atlanta to become music superstars. Reality soon dawns on the girlsâ€™ fantasies, and they start to learn that ambition often comes at a cost. And sometimes that cost is too high.</p>

            <p class="wordchange"><strong>Why Star Is One of My Favorite TV Show?</strong></p>
            
            <p>Star is one of my favorite tv shows because instead of a rich white girl (Star) taking to make it in the music industy, its a rich black girl (Alex) who wants to make a name for herself without being known as her father's daughter. Star and her sister (simone) grew up in a semi-poor neighbor and their mother died due to Star accidenctly giving her mother the drugsas a young child not knowing exactly what was it for. <p class="pchange">If you're insterested in the story line so far, go watch Star on <a href="http://www.fox.com/star/" target="_blank">Fox.</a></p>
