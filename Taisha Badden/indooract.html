			<p>When we think about exercise, we think about challenging workouts but that's not the case.If you're someone that doesn't workout, it's fine. Excerising includes walking, yoga, pilates and sports. Sounds simple enough. You don't have to exercise 24/7, but at least try 2 days a week than graudally do more days. Exercise is good for every aspect of our lives physically, mentually, emotionally, and spirtually. It can be a hastil at first, but you will feel good about yourself towards the end."</p>
		
		<center>HangOut With Your Pet</center>

			<p>Pets are the same as humans too, they love and support everything you do. So it shouldn't be weird. Pets helps reduce stress, lower blood pressure, decline the feelings of anxiety and they help you coop with depression. Even so, they help people with PTSD disorders.</p>

		<p>Instead feeling bad about yourself, you can make a nice healthy meal for yourself or even family and friends. Eating the right foods can increase our alertness and concentration. It can prevent short-term memory loss and inflammation. Make sure to cook foods with lots of vitimans such as blueberries, spinach, nuts, fish, leafy green vegatables and so on. For a much more healthy meal, try making <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/true-superfoods">superfoods</a> meals.
