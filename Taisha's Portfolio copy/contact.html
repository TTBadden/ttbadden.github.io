        <h1>Bio</h1>
		<p>My name is Taisha Badden. I am 20 years old and enrolled in New Media Technology as a multimedia designer. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and still currently living there. My passion for art and design started in my early childhood. Many in my family would say that I was naturally gifted in drawing. Or that my uncle’s skills were passed on to me. Art is a calling to me, more like my outlet into a different universe. As growing up, I was involved in different aspects of art. Such as theater, dance, drawing and graphic design. “Someone is always going to be better than you. If you want to become better, become better for yourself and not for anyone else.” - Someone Close. This quote inspires me to improve my skills and learn to become better at what you’re good at for yourself as an accomplishment.
