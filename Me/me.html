<h1>Brief Biograpghy</h1>

<p> Hi my name is Taisha Badden and here is the story that helped me to become the person I am today towards my goal. </p>
  <p> I was born in March 1999 and throughout my childhood, I had always wanted to become a dancer; a background dancer or an artist. I had always loved video games but by the age of seven my brother introduce me to a video game called Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and I was automaically addicted. For my age I guess that I couldn't break law, so this game was an outlet to me. Then my brother again got this game for the Xbox 360 called Devil May Cry 4. Even though I didn't played it as much, I just loved the game because it was something different to me. I loved the weirdness, the storyine, the graphics and the unique characters (mostly the demons and bosses). In my middle school years, I started to get Game Informers and talk about video games to my friends. But was always taking after school dance programs, performancing on stage and taking art classes. In my high school years, I started to worry about my future and what I wanted to do. I thought about becoming a dancer, but I heard it was a long process. But still is an second option. I started thinking about my inetersts since I can draw and am fascinated about tecnology, video games specifically, thought about the videos of how my favorite games were process.
